This folder contains csv files with the mean test set correlations for all evaluated prediction pipelines.
The different columns of the csv correspond to the mean test r, the brain parcellation, the feature class,the ROI (for RCP feature class) / num features (for the wholebrain, corr and PCA feature class), the SC weighting, the trait, and the subject selection.
This makes it possible to determine how specific combinations of pipeline conditions perform to predict a certain target.
